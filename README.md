Why, hello there - 
I am Paige and I am a grad student at Drexel University, working to get me MLIS. I love cats 😻, monkeys🐒, penguins 🐧, and koalas 🐨. I love to read books 📚 and National Geographic Magazine 🤓 and I love to bake 🎂 because when you are done there is usually something yummy to eat! 😋
